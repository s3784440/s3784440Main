									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
									<p><strong>
										<br>
										Information Technology covers a broad range of industries from education, engineering, medical, business etc. My interest in IT is the interoperability of the profession which is in demand ubiquitously. The profession has many challenges which make the job interesting because it requires a team of people committed to solving the problem. Everyone is unique, and I enjoy working with other people sharing ideas and learning from others’ experience to create software solutions. </br>
										<br>
										From a young age, I always like to study mechanisms inside toys and make an understanding of how they operate. One of the most memorable things is installing a gearbox inside a model toy train; I was mesmerised by how something so simple could have many gearings and how it translated to the movement of the train. My parents taught me how to use the IBM Windows 2000 – I learned the basics of the computer, navigating and accessing programs such as Microsoft Paint and Word. One of the first games that I have encountered was Tetris. I questioned that a computer must have a set of instructions that make it ‘operate like something magical’. It was then that I learned about the existence of code and I began to love and gradually study the ‘gearbox inside a computer’.</br>
										<br>
										In the present day, I have gained some experience in junior software development skills by completing Unit 3/4 Software Development Course during the Victorian Certificate of Education. The program covers basic aspects of working as a junior programmer with topics and tasks revolving around project management, software conventions and user-centered-design & interface. </br>
										<br>
										The set of skills that I have attained from completing the course allows for the management and creation of software solution to delivery and support for the client. I have created a solution which assisted in the management of an Electronic Automotive Vehicle Logbook (ELAV) which the user can log and track remarks of multiple vehicles. The program assisted the client as there were multiple drivers that would be using the vehicle. </br>

									<h2>RMIT is the Place for Study</h2>
									<p>
									<strong>
									<br>
									I choose to study at RMIT University because of its world-class status and reputation in Information Technology. Attending a university which specialises in the industry that is prominent in the twenty-first century is a privilege; hard work and passion in the field will in the long run blossom. The location of the RMIT City Campus makes it an advantage as it is in the CBD and nearby to corporate offices. It is essential to have the ability to broaden horizons especially when it comes to developing a career and opportunities.</br>
									<br>
									I expect to learn the intermediate to advanced IT skills by completion of the Bachelor of Information Technology degree. I look forward to entering the IT industry as a junior software developer, working in the corporate environment and learning new skills from senior developers. As I am still studying as a student programmer, I view university as a place to experiment with my skills and maintain good discipline in time management and teamwork expansion. The basic programming languages taught by the University consist of Python and Java, which can be applied in the working environment to create software solutions. Although the skills that I will learn in University will be the foundation of my career, I am always eager to learn new things with a fast-paced tempo.</br>

							<h2>Plan and Strategy </h2>
							<strong>
								<p>
								I am currently scheduled to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology Degree by 2021. During the three-year period, I will study the essential foundation skills of working as a junior programmer in the IT industry. There are several major corporations that exist in Melbourne locally and around Australia; I intend to work for a major corporation in my career as a software developer.
								</p>
								<p>
								Career progression in the industry comes with experience and skills which satisfies the requirements. I am eager to learn new skills and given the opportunity to train for new abilities. The incentive for the company is that I will be able to contribute back to the company, therefore the monetary and time resource the company invest is returned in the form of human resource.
								</p>
								<p>
								I am dedicated to working with other people on team projects. It is an opportunity to develop communication and social skills, as learning from other people’s skills. Working in team projects challenges your abilities and with each success, it improves your interpersonal skills which prepare for the next hurdle in the corporate environment. A programmer in a corporate environment requires the assistance of teamwork to achieve the common goal.
								</p>
								<p>
								The IT Industry is ever-changing with perpetual upgrades in terms of systems and methodology. I see it is essential to be adaptable to the changing environment because otherwise, we will become obsolete, therefore not qualified to be able to work.
								</p>
								<p>
								I want to always keep learning so that my skills will not become obsolete, and I will plan to reach seniority in the industry in the coming decades.
								</p>
								<p>
								The years of learning many programming languages will become useful as I would be able to teach the next generation of developers the essential skills required to work in the field. As a senior developer, I intend to teach and share my experiences and inspire juniors while working providing mentorship and feedback. 
								</p>
								<p>
								As a Senior Developer, I will have the responsibility to lead in the field and fulfil the goal of projects. Senior Developers are not only capable of creating advanced algorithms and programming, but they are also individuals who care for their team and understand their capabilities. It is important to understand the team because they play a vital role in achieving success.

							<h1>Project Plan</h1>
							<h2>ALTITUDE</h2>
							<strong>
								<p>
								ALTITUDE is a proposed mobile software solution which aims to assist pilots while flying aircraft in the skies above. In the present day, the use of mobile technologies such as tablets has become common practice in schools and at home in terms of their applications and usage. The flight deck of an aircraft whilst above the ground is an extremely busy environment, where the inputs and decision making of the pilots ultimately dictate the outcome of the plane. Aviation is a highly dynamic industry in which the culture and technology are constantly ever-changing, and this makes the project a perfect opportunity to be implemented for the emphasis on today’s modern era.
								</p>
								<p>
								The workload of pilots during take-off climb and coming to approach are at its highest because they will have to perform multiple checklists to configure the aircraft at each stage. Aviators are highly-trained professionals who have the responsibility for the aircraft they are in command for and getting it from Point A to Point B safely. Modern aviation is filled with automation and sophistication in technology, however, the pilot has to always to be alert for maintaining safe operation of the aircraft at all times.  Software solution of a similar kind have already existed; however, it is seen that it is still an opportunity to improve and upgrade current solutions. Simpler solutions and ease of use consume less time for pilots to learn and use while they are flying.
								</p>
								<p>
								The program is designed to be simple and intuitive; it is projected to have three different modes in which the pilots can change seamlessly. 
								</p>
								<p>
								These modes are Ground, Departure, Flight, and Approach:
								</p>
								<p>
								Ground Mode is designed to assist pilots in the sense of navigating around an airport and provide relevant information such as briefing on notices and memos. The ground environment is a busy space at airports may have dozens of aircraft moving simultaneously. For the pilots, it is their responsibility to avoid any potential hazards or obstacles which may impact the aircraft’s operation. The system would primarily assist in plotting taxiway routes and also the flight requirements such as fuel quantity, take-off weight, temperature factor, Air Traffic frequency and center of gravity calculations (retrospect to the aircraft type).
								</p>
								<p>
								Departure Mode is designed to be used from the Runway up to when it has left the airfield’s airspace, providing information such as speed values and waypoint tracks. The speed values will be based on the inputs made in Ground Mode. The critical speeds to be cross-checked with the onboard flight computer, to minimise the risk of errors and discrepancies. The crew would have to plot their course through the use of waypoints; these are GPS coordinate positions which serves as markers for aircraft traffic. The software solution would serve as a secondary backup system during flight, in case the primary Flight Management Computer FMS become redundant or experience failure.
								</p>
								<p>
								Flight Mode is designed to be used during a climb to cruising altitude or above 10,000 feet. The workload of the pilots after climbing above this level is significantly reduced, however, they will still need to be alert of the situation in case of any problems arising in this stage. The system would provide information on possible Alternate Airports in case there is a requirement to divert. During this phase, the crew would be more relaxed than any other stages of flight. There is a term called ‘controlled-rest’ where one pilot would take rest while the other would be flying the plane and monitoring the system. The risk of controlled-rest is that in case both pilots are simultaneously ‘resting’, there would be no-one monitoring the aircraft’s systems. An Aural Warning feature would automatically be enabled in the software solution, providing 15-minute intervals of silence and 30 seconds prior to the system would prompt have inputs made from the pilots. A high- and low-pitched sound will play otherwise if no inputs have been made. This is designed to alert the pilots to make sure they are aware and well informed of their situation.
								</p>
								<p>
								Approach mode is designed to help assist with the approach and landing of the aircraft; the system in this stage would strictly give only the relevant information as it will be the most critical stage of flight. The pilots can use the system to open charts, input taxiway routing, and ATC frequency information. The system will be almost ‘static’ yet still interactive so that the pilots can focus on managing and configuring the aircraft for landing. Upon landing and the aircraft is safely on the taxiway, the system would prompt to switch to Ground Mode with the information from the Approach Mode entries.
								</p>
								<p>
								The philosophy of ALTITUDE is a modular system in which features of the program can be upgraded and improved. The pilots can also make their change the layout of the modules as to their preference.
								</p>
								<p>
								As the software is designed to be a mobile solution, this means that it has a variety of programming languages which are compatible and can be executed almost on any device. The language of preference for the test bed of the solution would be Java because it can run on Android or iOS. It is more accessible and consumes less time to build a solution than using other exotic programming languages. As the solution will operate independently of the aircraft’s computer systems, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority permits devices with a minimum size of a tablet to serve as a solution.
								</p>
								<p>
								The skills required to make the program is to have a developer of more than 5 years’ experience because of the nature and magnitude of the intended purpose of the solution. This is to prevent minor errors which could cascade and cause system failures. A developer with Aviation Knowledge would be beneficial when it comes to understanding the philosophy and discipline of management in the flight-deck. It is important that both parties – user and developer – consult with each other for the interface and functions of the final product version.
								</p>
								<p>
								The outcome from the project, if it becomes successful, is that initially, it would be used for General Aviation pilots for their personal use and training. Future versions of the system would be designed to mimic the systems already on-board larger aircraft so that training pilots are able to get an insight on how to manage automation and flying. The solution may hold a firm recognition in the industry and when other companies want to further develop it, they will require licensing from the original developer. The main mission of the solution is simple; to improve flight safety and management.
